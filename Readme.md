### How to Use:
1. **Enter Video URL**: Copy the YouTube video URL and paste it into the URL input field.
2. **Fetch Qualities**: Click the **Fetch Qualities** button. Wait until the button becomes active (black) again, indicating that it has finished fetching the available video qualities.
3. **Select Quality**: Choose your desired video quality from the dropdown menu.
4. **Choose Download Location**: Select the folder where you want to save the downloaded video.
5. **Download Video**: Click the **Download** button to start the download process.

### Notes:
- After pressing the **Download** button, it might take a few seconds for the download to start.
- If you want to download another video, make sure to repeat the process by pasting the new URL and pressing **Fetch Qualities** again.
- Fetching video qualities can take **5–20 seconds**, depending on the video.
- If the application shows "Not Responding" during the quality-fetching process, don't worry—this is normal, and it will resume functioning once the fetching process is complete.

### Important Notice for First-Time Users  
- The first time you open the application, it might take a few seconds to initialize—this is normal.  
- If you encounter a **Windows Defender SmartScreen** warning, click **More Info** and then select **Run Anyway** to proceed. This happens because the application is unsigned but is completely safe to use.

### Why I Made This
I created this application because most websites and applications for downloading YouTube videos require payment or subscriptions. As a hobbyist video editor, I wanted a free and straightforward solution. Although I don't have much experience with Python, I managed to build this thanks to the little help of ChatGPT.
